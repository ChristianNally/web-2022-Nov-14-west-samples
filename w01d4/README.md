# W01D04 - Callbacks!

### To Do
- [x] Functions as values
- [x] Function calling vs function passing
- [x] Callbacks and higher order functions
- [x] Anonymous functions
- [x] Arrow functions
- [x] Make our own higher order function

const myArray = new Array()
const myArray = [];

jQuery()
jQuery.ajax();

callback = a function that we pass to another function to be invoked/called by that function
higher order function (hof) = a function that accepts another function as an argument OR a function that returns a function

single responsiblity principle = ideally your functions/code should do one thing only

inversion of control

map
filter
reduce
